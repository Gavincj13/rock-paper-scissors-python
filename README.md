# rock-paper-scissors-python-
A rock paper scissors game that allows the user to play the computer. Game has two modes, regular rock-paper-scissors, and rock-paper-scissors-lizard-spock from the tv show big bang theory. 
This code was taken from a tutorial online on how to create a working rock paper scissors game using python. The tutorial showed what is needed, and offered insight as to how to get it all working. 
Overall, I really enjoyed coding this game, as it included a lot of the steps that I have learned so far in coding, as well as a lot of new challenges that once I figured them out were really exciting to see work. I would highly recommend this writing this code for beginners to learn about how to code a terminal-based game as well as learn about different levels and skills in coding overall.
